# proxy-draft

This is a tool to 

## Setup

You'll need `imagemagick` and `montage` installed. On a Mac, I installed both using Homebrew:

```
$ brew install imagemagick
$ brew install montage
```

To install the go dependencies, run this from the project directory:

```
$ go get -d ./...
```

Make sure there exist subdirectories `boosters` and `cards`. `mtg.go` stores card images in `./cards` and outputs booster pack PDFs to `./boosters`.

## Usage

### Cleanup

To remove downloaded card image files and generated booster pack PDFs, run:

```
$ bash cleanup.sh
```

### Draft

Right now draft parameters are hard-coded into `mtg.go`.

## Set codes

These are, roughly, the valid set codes for this program.

If there weren't booster packs issues for the set you select, the program will not generate booster packs. I've removed a number of these sets already––for example, the Duel Decks––but haven't done so exhaustively.
